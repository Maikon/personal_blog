In the [previous post]() we outlined what a multi-tenant whitelabel application is. We also got our hands dirty by creating a new Phoenix application and we added the foundations for the app to be accessible via different sub-domains as well as a root domain. The code for that post can be found [here]().

In this article we will extend our app to use a custom router and dispatch subdomain requests to a separate controller which then loads different pages than our root domain.

### Adding subdomain routing

In the last post we went through the concept of adding a custom plug to capture a given subdomain and store it in the connection struc (`conn`). We then used that information to display *different data on the same page*. We'll take this a step further now by adding the necessary code to display a *different page altogether*.

[Our code](link-to-repo) from last time uses the same router and serves the same page albeit with different data for requests coming from both the root domain and a subdomain. We want requests coming from a subdomain to be handled by a different router.

Create a new file under the `lib/fresco_web` directory called `subdomain_router.ex`. Add the following code inside of it:

```elixir
# lib/fresco_web/subodomain_router.ex

defmodule FrescoWeb.SubdomainRouter do
  use FrescoWeb, :router

  pipeline :browser do
    plug :accepts, ["html"]
    plug :fetch_session
    plug :fetch_live_flash
    plug :put_root_layout, {FrescoWeb.LayoutView, :root}
    plug :protect_from_forgery
    plug :put_secure_browser_headers
  end

  pipeline :api do
    plug :accepts, ["json"]
  end

  scope "/", FrescoWeb.Subdomain do
    pipe_through :browser

    get "/", PageController, :index
  end
end
```

You might think this looks identical to the existing router found under `lib/fresco_web/router.ex` and you are largely correct. The main difference is on the line starting with `scope`. This is the code from `lib/fresco_web/router.ex`:

```elixir
scope "/", FrescoWeb do
  pipe_through :browser

  get "/", PageController, :index
end
```

In our new router, we're scoping the incoming queries to a different context called `Subdomain` :

```elixir
scope "/", FrescoWeb.Subdomain
```



**Note:** You might be thinking *"Why do I need another router? Can't I do all of that in same router?"*. You probably can but there are some good reasons to have separate routers:

- clearer code organisation and separation
  - Smaller modules
  - Easier/quicker to conceptually parse vs a single file with mixed responsibilities
- Custom configuration (i.e pipelines, plugs etc) can be added that's only applicable to routing subdomains or vice verca

Now that we have a subdomain router, let's use it. Open the endpoint file `lib/fresco_web/endpoint.ex` and change the line where we added our subdomain plug and change this code:

```elixir
plug FrescoWeb.Plugs.Subdomain
```

to this:

```elixir
plug FrescoWeb.Plugs.Subdomain, %{ subdomain_router: FrescoWeb.SubdomainRouter }
```

Previously our `Subdomain` plug was initialised without any additional options. Now we're passing additional options, in this case a map, containing our newly created `SubdomainRouter`. This means we also need to change our code in the plug subdomain file `lib/fresco_web/plugs/subdomain.ex` to make use of this change:

```elixir
defmodule FrescoWeb.Plugs.Subdomain do
  @behaviour Plug

  import Plug.Conn, only: [put_private: 3]

  # we will use the options parameter and merge the incoming options with the existing one
  def init(opts) do
    Map.merge(
      opts,
      %{ root_host: FrescoWeb.Endpoint.config(:url)[:host] }
    )
  end

# unpack subdomain_router argument
  def call(%Plug.Conn{host: host} = conn, %{root_host: root_host, subdomain_router: router}) do
    case extract_subdomain(host, root_host) do
      subdomain when byte_size(subdomain) > 0 ->
        put_private(conn, :subdomain, subdomain)
        |> router.call(router.init({})) # <--- call the router with the incoming connection
      _ ->
        conn
    end
  end

  defp extract_subdomain(host, root_host) do
    String.replace(host, ~r/.?#{root_host}/, "")
  end
end
```

Restart the Phoenix server, visit a subdomain like http://green.fresco.com:4000/ and you should be greeted with....an error:

![phoenix routing error](/assets/phoenix_whitelabel_series//phoenix_controller_error.png)

Remember this line `scope "/", FrescoWeb.Subdomain` in our `SubdomainRouter`? Since the requests are now scoped to a `Subdomain` namespace, our app is looking for a `PageController` in that namespace.

Create a new directory under `lib/fresco_web/` called `subdomain`:

```bash
mkdir lib/fresco_web/subdomain
```

Inside of that new directory, create a file called `page_controller.ex` and add the following code:

```elixir
defmodule FrescoWeb.Subdomain.PageController do
  use FrescoWeb, :controller

  def index(conn, _params) do
    render(conn, "index.html", %{subdomain: conn.private[:subdomain]})
  end
end
```

Refresh the page in the browser. Indeed, another error greets us:

![phoenix view error](/assets/phoenix_whitelabel_series//phoenix_view_missing.png)

The error, like before, it's telling us pretty clear the next action we need to take. Since now our `Subdomain.PageController` is used, during `render` it's trying to find a `View` (`PageView`) that's under the same namespace (`Subdomain`). Create a new directory called `subdomain` under `lib/fresco_web/views/` and a new a file inside of that called `page_view.ex`:

```bash
mkdir lib/fresco_web/views/subdomain
touch lib/fresco_web/views/subdomain/page_view.ex
```

and add the following code inside of it:

```elixir
defmodule FrescoWeb.Subdomain.PageView do
  use FrescoWeb, :view
end
```

Refresh the page http://green.fresco.com:4000/ and:

![phoenix view error](/assets/phoenix_whitelabel_series//phoenix_template_missing.png)

I'm not trolling you, I promise. The reason I'm taking you on this journey is to show the "invisible" connecting dots between the different components that would otherwise be less obvious had I given you all of the code up front and skipped the step by step process.

We're almost there, one more file:

```bash
# create recursively two directories: subdomain and inside of it, page
mkdir -p lib/fresco_web/templates/subdomain/page/

# the file our error is looking for
touch lib/fresco_web/templates/subdomain/page/index.html.heex
```

Inside our new file `lib/fresco_web/templates/subdomain/page/index.html.heex` add the following:

```html
<section class="phx-hero">
  <h1><%= gettext "Welcome to %{name}!", name: @subdomain %></h1>
  <p>Peace of mind from prototype to production</p>
</section>

<section class="row">
  <article class="column">

```

Refresh the page at http://green.fresco.com:4000/ and voila:

![phoenix view error](/assets/phoenix_whitelabel_series//phoenix_subdomain_controller_success.png)

Let's refresh the other pages as well, our root domain http://fresco.com:4000/ and our other subdomain http://farm.fresco.com:4000/. You should see a great image of success:

![phoenix view error](/assets/phoenix_whitelabel_series//phoenix_subdomain_routing_success.png)

As you can see, our root domain apart from a different greeting it also displays the additional "Help" section since it's been handled by a different controller that renders a different template.

Let's address something you may have noticed in your server logs back in the terminal. More specifically this error:

```bash

  Pipelines: [:browser]

        (cowboy 2.9.0)
```

Remember the change we did in our endpoint file where we added our `Subdomain` plug right before the `Router` plug:

```elixir
plug FrescoWeb.Plugs.Subdomain, %{ subdomain_router: FrescoWeb.SubdomainRouter }
plug FrescoWeb.Router
```

Because our `Subdomain` plug now calls our new `SubdomainRouter` a response is sent already from the server. Our Subdomain plug then returns the conn which is passed to the `FrescoWeb.Router` which in turn tries to send a response as well causing the above error. We can fix this error by using the [`halt`](https://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Conn.html#halt/1) function to prevent any further plus futher down the pipeline (i.e `FrescoWeb.Router`) from executing:

```elixir
defmodule FrescoWeb.Plugs.Subdomain do
  @behaviour Plug

  import Plug.Conn, only: [put_private: 3, halt: 1] # import the function

...

  def call(%Plug.Conn{host: host} = conn, %{root_host: root_host, subdomain_router: router}) do
    case extract_subdomain(host, root_host) do
      subdomain when byte_size(subdomain) > 0 ->
        put_private(conn, :subdomain, subdomain)
        |> router.call(router.init({}))
        |> halt() # <--- halt further execution
      _ ->
        conn
    end
  end

...

end
```

That's it, we did it. We removed the final error and our app is capable of handling requests from different domains and passing them to the appropriate router to handle. There a lot of information to take in and explore further in this post so give yourself a pad on the back and a well-deserved break.

In our next post we'll take this ability to dynamically display custom content a step further with the introduction of user accounts aka tenants!
